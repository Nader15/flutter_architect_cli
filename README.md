## ⚡ Quick Start

Create a new Flutter project with architecture scaffolding:

```bash
flutter_architect create my_app
```

You'll be prompted to select an architecture pattern and state management:

```
🚀 Creating Flutter project: my_app

📁 Please select an architecture pattern:

1. Clean Architecture Pattern
2. MVC Pattern
3. MVVM Pattern

Enter your choice (1-3): 1

🎛️  Please select a state management solution:

1. BLoC (Cubit)
2. Provider
3. Riverpod
4. GetX

Enter your choice (1-4): 1

🎯 Selected Architecture: Clean Architecture Pattern
🎯 Selected State Management: BLoC (Cubit)

✅ Clean Architecture project created successfully!
```

The CLI will scaffold your complete project structure with the selected architecture and state management — start developing immediately!

---

### **3. MVVM Pattern ✅**

**Best for:** Medium to large apps, data-binding focus, modern Flutter apps

#### 📁 Structure:
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── theme/
│   └── services/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── datasources/
│   └── api/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── usecases/
└── presentation/
    ├── views/
    ├── viewmodels/
    ├── widgets/
    └── state/
```

#### 🌟 Key Benefits
- Strong data binding  
- Clear separation of UI and logic  
- Easier unit testing  
- Suitable for complex UIs  

#### 🧰 Technologies
- Multiple state management options (BLoC Cubit, Provider, Riverpod, GetX)
